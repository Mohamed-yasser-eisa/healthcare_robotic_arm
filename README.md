# healthcare_robotic_arm
 
Build date: (19 July, 2021)

This is my graduation project, it was a team based project.

1- Project description:

    A fully controlled robotic arm that can help doctors to measure vital signs of 
    the patients like the temperature and heart rate, from a far distance or any 
    place in the hospital, the arm has 4 joints to move in 4 degrees 
    of freedoms to get to the given position in real world.

2- Tools:

    (STM32F103C8T6, 4 large servomotors with magnetic encoder, MATLAB, Simulink, 
    magnetic encoder, temperature sensor, power supply, I2C motor driver, Arduino 
    IDE).
